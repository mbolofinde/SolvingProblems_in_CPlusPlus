2- Write a program to calculate employee’s wage. Your program first asks the user to enter the
number of hours an employee works in one week (a float value). Then, it calculates this
employee’s wage based on the following formula:
(1) Hourly pay rate is $18.25 for the first normal 40.0 hours
(2) An overtime pay-rate factor of 1.5 is applied to the overtime hours
The wage displayed should have 2 digits fraction part because of the money unit. The “if-
else” statement is required.
